description: "The Royal Book of Oz (1921) is the fifteenth in the series of Oz books,\
  \ and the first by Ruth Plumly Thompson, to be written after L. Frank Baum's death.\
  \ Although Baum was credited as the author, it was written entirely by Thompson.\
  \ Beginning in the 1980s, some editions have correctly credited Thompson, although\
  \ the cover of the 2001 edition by Dover Publications credits only Baum. The original\
  \ introduction claimed that the book was based on notes by Baum, but this has been\
  \ disproved. Baum's surviving notes, known as \"An Oz Book\"  are known from four\
  \ typewritten pages found at his publisher's, but their authenticity as Baum's work\
  \ has been disputed. Even if genuine, they bear no resemblance to Thompson's book.\n\
